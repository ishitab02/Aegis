AEGIS is the immune system for DeFi.

Three AI agents watch protocols 24/7 - one monitors liquidity, one watches price feeds, one guards governance. When two of three detect a threat, circuit breakers trigger automatically.

The Euler hack took $197 million in 10 minutes. AEGIS would have detected it in 12 seconds.

We use Chainlink CRE for verifiable execution, x402 for payments, and ERC-8004 for agent reputation. It's not just detection - our ChainSherlock AI investigates and generates forensic reports in real-time.

We're building for the Chainlink Convergence hackathon, targeting the Risk & Compliance track with 5 Chainlink services integrated.
